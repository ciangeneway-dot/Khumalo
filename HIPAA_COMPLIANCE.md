# HIPAA Compliance Guide

## Overview
This document outlines the HIPAA compliance measures implemented in the Medical Practice Management System to ensure the protection of Protected Health Information (PHI).

## üîí Administrative Safeguards

### 1. Security Officer Assignment
- **Designated Security Officer**: Assign a qualified individual to oversee security policies
- **Contact Information**: Ensure 24/7 availability for security incidents
- **Training Requirements**: Regular HIPAA training for all staff members

### 2. Workforce Training
- **Initial Training**: All users must complete HIPAA training before system access
- **Ongoing Education**: Quarterly refresher courses on privacy and security
- **Incident Reporting**: Clear procedures for reporting potential breaches

### 3. Access Management
- **Role-Based Access**: Different access levels for different user types
- **Minimum Necessary**: Users only access PHI necessary for their job function
- **Regular Audits**: Monthly review of user access and permissions

## üõ°Ô∏è Physical Safeguards

### 1. Workstation Security
- **Automatic Logoff**: 15-minute timeout for inactive sessions
- **Screen Locks**: Password-protected screen savers
- **Secure Workstations**: Dedicated computers for PHI access only

### 2. Device and Media Controls
- **Encrypted Storage**: All devices storing PHI must be encrypted
- **Secure Disposal**: Proper destruction of devices containing PHI
- **Media Controls**: Tracking and secure handling of all storage media

## üîê Technical Safeguards

### 1. Access Control
```typescript
// Row Level Security (RLS) in Supabase
CREATE POLICY "Users can only access their organization's patients"
  ON patients FOR ALL
  TO authenticated
  USING (auth.jwt() ->> 'organization_id' = organization_id);
```

### 2. Audit Controls
- **Login Logging**: All authentication attempts are logged
- **Document Access**: Track who accessed which documents and when
- **Data Modifications**: Log all changes to patient records
- **Retention Policy**: Maintain audit logs for 6 years

### 3. Integrity
- **Data Validation**: Input validation to prevent data corruption
- **Checksums**: Verify data integrity during transmission
- **Version Control**: Track all changes to patient records

### 4. Transmission Security
- **HTTPS Everywhere**: All data transmission encrypted with TLS 1.3
- **API Security**: Secure API endpoints with proper authentication
- **Network Security**: VPN requirements for remote access

## üîí Data Encryption

### 1. Encryption at Rest
```typescript
// Azure Blob Storage encryption
const uploadOptions = {
  metadata: {
    encryption: 'AES256',
    patientId: metadata.patientId,
    // ... other metadata
  }
};
```

### 2. Encryption in Transit
- **TLS 1.3**: All client-server communication encrypted
- **API Security**: JWT tokens with short expiration times
- **Database Connections**: Encrypted connections to Supabase

### 3. Key Management
- **Azure Key Vault**: Centralized key management
- **Key Rotation**: Regular rotation of encryption keys
- **Access Controls**: Restricted access to encryption keys

## üìã Business Associate Agreements (BAAs)

### Required BAAs
1. **Microsoft Azure**: For cloud infrastructure services
2. **Supabase**: For database and authentication services
3. **Google**: For OAuth authentication services
4. **Any Third-Party Vendors**: Who may access PHI

### BAA Requirements
- **Written Agreements**: All BAAs must be in writing
- **Safeguard Requirements**: Vendors must implement appropriate safeguards
- **Breach Notification**: Vendors must report breaches within 60 days
- **Termination Rights**: Right to terminate if vendor violates BAA

## üö® Incident Response Plan

### 1. Breach Detection
- **Automated Monitoring**: Real-time monitoring for suspicious activity
- **User Reporting**: Clear procedures for users to report incidents
- **Regular Audits**: Monthly security audits and vulnerability assessments

### 2. Response Procedures
```typescript
// Incident response workflow
const incidentResponse = {
  detection: "Automated monitoring + user reports",
  assessment: "Determine scope and impact within 1 hour",
  containment: "Isolate affected systems immediately",
  notification: "Notify patients within 60 days if required",
  documentation: "Complete incident report within 24 hours"
};
```

### 3. Breach Notification
- **Patient Notification**: Within 60 days of discovery
- **HHS Notification**: Within 60 days for breaches affecting 500+ individuals
- **Media Notification**: Within 60 days for breaches affecting 500+ individuals in same state
- **Documentation**: Maintain records of all breach notifications

## üìä Risk Assessment

### 1. Regular Risk Assessments
- **Annual Reviews**: Comprehensive risk assessment annually
- **Quarterly Updates**: Update risk assessment quarterly
- **Incident-Based**: Additional assessments after security incidents

### 2. Risk Mitigation
```typescript
// Risk mitigation strategies
const riskMitigation = {
  dataBreach: "Multi-factor authentication, encryption, access controls",
  unauthorizedAccess: "Role-based access, audit logging, session management",
  dataLoss: "Regular backups, redundancy, disaster recovery",
  malware: "Antivirus software, regular updates, user training"
};
```

## üîç Monitoring and Auditing

### 1. Continuous Monitoring
- **Real-time Alerts**: Immediate notification of security events
- **Performance Monitoring**: Track system performance and availability
- **User Activity**: Monitor user access patterns and behaviors

### 2. Audit Logs
```typescript
// Audit log structure
interface AuditLog {
  timestamp: string;
  userId: string;
  action: 'login' | 'logout' | 'view_patient' | 'upload_document' | 'generate_summary';
  resourceId?: string;
  ipAddress: string;
  userAgent: string;
  success: boolean;
  details?: string;
}
```

### 3. Regular Reviews
- **Monthly Reviews**: Review audit logs monthly
- **Quarterly Assessments**: Comprehensive security assessments
- **Annual Audits**: Third-party security audits

## üìã Documentation Requirements

### 1. Required Documentation

- **Risk Assessments**: Annual risk assessment documentation
- **Training Records**: Documentation of staff training
- **Incident Reports**: Complete incident response documentation

### 2. Documentation Retention
